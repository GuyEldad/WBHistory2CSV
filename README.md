## Important Notice

Some antivirus software may flag the executable version of this tool as a false positive. This is due to the way the tool interacts with system files and browser history databases. The tool is built using **Python** and **PyInstaller**, which can sometimes trigger heuristic detections.

If you encounter warnings, please consider the following:

- Running the tool in a sandbox environment.
- Adding an exclusion rule for the executable in your antivirus software.
- Temporarily disabling your antivirus software.
